# AI-Powered Voice Answer Extraction - Testing Guide

## Implementation Complete! ✅

The AI-powered voice answer extraction system is now **fully integrated** in both backend and frontend.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend (Complete ✅)
1. **AI Answer Extractor Service** - `backend/app/services/ai_answer_extractor.py`
2. **Enhanced Audio Schemas** - `backend/app/schemas/audio_schemas.py`
3. **Updated Audio API** - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/audio.py`

### Frontend (Complete ✅)
1. **Updated Hook Types** - Added AI fields to `MatchedOption` interface
2. **Question Stem Passing** - Hook now sends `question_stem` to API for AI context
3. **Enhanced UI Display** - VoiceInputButton shows:
   - 🟢🟡🔴 Confidence badges
   - 💭 Student reasoning
   - ⚠️ Uncertainty warnings
   - 🔄 Changed mind indicators
4. **Auto-Submit Delay** - 2-second review period before submission

## How to Test

### Prerequisites

1. **Backend running** with OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

2. **Frontend running**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Microphone permissions** granted in browser

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Simple Answer
**Test:** Say just "B"

**Expected Result:**
- 🟢 High confidence (>80%)
- Matched to option B
- Auto-submits after 2 seconds
- Shows "AI-powered" method

#### Scenario 2: Thinking Aloud
**Test:** Say "I think 2 plus 3 equals 5, so the answer is B"

**Expected Result:**
- 🟢 High confidence
- Shows reasoning: "Student calculated 2+3=5 and selected option B"
- Matched to option B
- Auto-submits after 2 seconds

#### Scenario 3: Uncertainty
**Test:** Say "Um, I'm not really sure, maybe C or D? I guess I'll go with C"

**Expected Result:**
- 🟡 Medium confidence (60-80%) or 🔴 Low (<60%)
- Shows uncertainty warning: "You seem uncertain"
- Lists uncertainty markers: "um", "not really sure", "maybe", "I guess"
- Matched to option C
- Auto-submits after 2 seconds (user can manually override if needed)

#### Scenario 4: Changed Mind
**Test:** Say "First I thought A, but wait, that's wrong. It's actually B"

**Expected Result:**
- 🟢 or 🟡 Confidence badge
- Shows "You changed your mind" indicator
- Reasoning: "Student revised from A to B after reconsideration"
- Matched to option B
- Auto-submits after 2 seconds

#### Scenario 5: Process of Elimination
**Test:** Say "A is definitely wrong because it's too small. B doesn't make sense. So I'll pick D"

**Expected Result:**
- 🟢 High confidence
- Reasoning: "Student eliminated A and B, chose D"
- Matched to option D
- Auto-submits after 2 seconds

#### Scenario 6: Very Uncertain
**Test:** Say "I have no idea, maybe A? Or B? I don't know"

**Expected Result:**
- 🔴 Low confidence (<60%)
- Shows strong uncertainty warning
- May match to A or show no match
- If matched, auto-submits after 2 seconds, but submit button stays enabled for override

## Visual Features

### Confidence Badges
- **🟢 Green** (≥80%): High confidence, auto-submit enabled
- **🟡 Yellow** (60-79%): Medium confidence, warning shown, auto-submit enabled
- **🔴 Red** (<60%): Low confidence, strong warning, auto-submit enabled but user encouraged to review

### Student Reasoning Display
```
💭 Your Thinking:
"Student calculated 2+3=5 and selected option B"
```
Shows up in a blue box when AI extracts reasoning.

### Uncertainty Warnings
```
⚠️ You seem uncertain
You said: "um", "not really sure", "maybe"
Take your time! You can change your answer before submitting.
```
Shows up in an amber/yellow box when uncertainty detected.

### Changed Mind Indicator
```
🔄 You changed your mind
That's okay! We captured your final answer.
```
Shows up in a purple box when student revises their answer.

## Testing Workflow

1. **Start diagnostic assessment**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/take-assessment
   - Click "Start Assessment"

2. **Use voice input**
   - Click the "Voice Answer" button (microphone icon)
   - Speak your answer
   - Watch for the pulsing red ring indicating recording
   - Click "Stop Recording" when done

3. **Observe AI processing**
   - "Processing..." indicator shows during transcription
   - Transcription appears: "You said: [your words]"
   - AI extraction results display with:
     - Confidence badge (🟢🟡🔴)
     - Matched answer
     - Reasoning (if complex response)
     - Warnings (if uncertain)
     - Changed mind indicator (if applicable)

4. **Review period**
   - 2-second countdown: "Auto-submitting answer in 2 seconds..."
   - Answer auto-selects (highlighted)
   - Submit button remains enabled
   - You can manually change selection during this time

5. **Submission**
   - After 2 seconds, answer auto-submits
   - Next question loads
   - Reasoning captured for teacher analytics

## API Response Structure

When voice input completes, the API returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "transcription": "I think 2 plus 3 equals 5, so the answer is B",
  "language": "en",
  "duration": 3.2,
  "matched_option_id": "B",
  "matched_value": "5",
  "confidence": 0.90,
  "extraction_method": "ai_gpt4_mini",
  "student_reasoning": "Student calculated 2+3=5 and selected option B",
  "uncertainty_markers": [],
  "changed_mind": false,
  "error": null
}
```

## Frontend Flow

1. **User clicks microphone** → Recording starts
2. **User speaks answer** → Audio captured
3. **User stops recording** → Audio sent to backend
4. **Backend transcribes** (Whisper) → Text returned
5. **Backend AI extracts** (GPT-4o Mini) → Answer + metadata returned
6. **Frontend displays**:
   - Transcript
   - Confidence badge
   - Reasoning
   - Warnings
7. **2-second delay** → User can review
8. **Auto-submit** → Answer submitted, next question loads

## Manual Override

At any point during the 2-second delay, the user can:
- Click a different option to change their answer
- Click submit immediately (doesn't need to wait 2 seconds)
- Let the auto-submit proceed

## Debugging

### Check Backend Logs
```bash
# Terminal running backend will show:
INFO: Using AI-powered answer extraction
INFO: AI extracted answer: B (confidence: 0.90)
```

### Check Browser Console
```javascript
// Should see:
🎤 Voice transcript: "I think 2+3=5, so B"
🎯 Matched option: { matched_option_id: "B", confidence: 0.90, ... }
✅ Voice matched: B → B (5)
🚀 Auto-submitting answer: B
```

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Transcription works but no match
**Solution:** Check that `question_stem` is being passed to the API. Look for the FormData in network tab.

**Issue:** No AI extraction, using regex fallback
**Solution:** Ensure `question_stem` is provided and not empty. Check backend logs for "Using regex fallback".

**Issue:** Low confidence scores
**Solution:** This is normal for genuinely uncertain responses. The system is working correctly by flagging uncertainty.

## Cost Monitoring

Each voice answer costs approximately:
- Whisper transcription: ~$0.006 per 10 seconds
- GPT-4o Mini extraction: ~$0.00004 per answer
- **Total: ~$0.00604 per voice answer**

For 1000 students × 5 questions = 5000 voice answers:
- **Total cost: ~$30.20**

## Teacher Analytics (Future Enhancement)

The captured reasoning is stored and will be available to teachers:
- View student thought processes
- Identify misconception patterns
- Understand problem-solving approaches
- Provide targeted feedback

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Backend integration** - Complete
2. ✅ **Frontend integration** - Complete
3. ⏳ **End-to-end testing** - Ready to test!
4. ⏳ **User acceptance testing** - Test with real students
5. ⏳ **Teacher dashboard** - Show reasoning in analytics

## Troubleshooting

### "Microphone access denied"
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure HTTPS or localhost
- Try different browser

### "Transcription failed"
- Check backend is running
- Verify OpenAI API key is set
- Check network tab for 500 errors

### "No match found"
- Complex responses may fail if question_stem missing
- Check that AI extraction is being used (look for "ai_gpt4_mini" in method)
- Ensure backend logs show "Using AI-powered answer extraction"

### Auto-submit not working
- Check browser console for timeout errors
- Verify `handleVoiceTranscription` is being called
- Look for 2-second setTimeout in logs

## Success Criteria

✅ Voice transcription works
✅ AI extracts answer from complex responses
✅ Reasoning is captured and displayed
✅ Confidence badges show correctly
✅ Uncertainty warnings appear when needed
✅ Changed mind indicator works
✅ 2-second auto-submit delay functions
✅ Submit button remains enabled for override
✅ System handles all test scenarios

## Demo Script

**Perfect for showing stakeholders:**

1. **Show simple answer**: "The answer is B" → 🟢 High confidence, instant match
2. **Show thinking aloud**: "I think 10 times 5 equals 50, so it's option C" → Shows reasoning
3. **Show uncertainty**: "Um, maybe A? Or B? I'm not sure" → Warning appears
4. **Show changed mind**: "First I thought A, no wait, B" → Changed mind indicator
5. **Show process**: "A is wrong, C is wrong, so D" → Reasoning captured

This demonstrates the full power of AI-powered voice input vs traditional pattern matching!
