## 📝 Additional Considerations

**Potential Enhancements (Post-MVP):**
- Multi-language support (Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa)
- Voice-to-text for assessments
- Handwriting recognition
- Offline mobile app (React Native)
- Blockchain certificates for achievements
- Integration with exam boards
- Parent mobile app
- AI tutor chatbot
- Augmented reality mathematics visualizations

**Questions to Address:**
- Will this be a SaaS platform or installed per school?
- What's the pricing model?
- Do you need provincial/national reporting?
- Integration with SA Department of Basic Education systems?
- Support for NSC/IEB exam formats?

Would you like me to:
1. **Expand any specific epic** into more detailed tickets?
2. **Create database schema diagrams**?
3. **Design API specifications**?
4. **Create wireframes** for key interfaces?
5. **Build a sprint plan** with dependencies?
6. **Estimate costs** for infrastructure and services?

This is your comprehensive roadmap to building an amazing AI mathematics teacher assistant for South African schools! 🚀📐
