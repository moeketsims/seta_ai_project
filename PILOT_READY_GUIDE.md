## ðŸŽ¯ How to Run Pilot Tomorrow

### Step 1: Start the System (5 minutes)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd /Users/mosiams/Desktop/ETDP_SETA_Repo/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend
cd /Users/mosiams/Desktop/ETDP_SETA_Repo/frontend
npm run dev
```

**Access URLs:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3001 (auto-selected because 3000 in use)
- AI Grading: http://localhost:3001/ai-grading
- Pathways: http://localhost:3001/pathways
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

---

### Step 2: Prepare Questions (10 minutes)

Create 5-10 CAPS-aligned mathematics questions for your grade level. Examples:

**Grade 5-6 Questions:**
1. "Solve: 3/4 + 1/2"
2. "Compare: 0.5 and 0.234. Which is larger?"
3. "What is 15% of 200?"
4. "Calculate: 10 Ã· 0.5"
5. "Which is larger: 1/3 or 1/5?"

**Have ready:**
- Question text
- Correct answer
- Paper assessments from learners

---

### Step 3: Collect Learner Answers (During Class)

**Option A: Paper-based (Recommended for first pilot)**
1. Give learners 5-10 questions on paper
2. Collect completed papers
3. You'll enter answers into system after class

**Option B: Direct entry**
1. Learners tell you their answers
2. You enter in real-time on `/ai-grading` page

---

### Step 4: Use AI Grading Page (15-30 minutes)

**Navigate to:** http://localhost:3001/ai-grading

**For each learner answer:**
1. Enter question content
2. Enter correct answer
3. Enter learner's answer
4. Select grade level
5. (Optional) Add show work
6. Click "Evaluate Answer"

**You'll see:**
- âœ… Score (0-10)
- âœ… Percentage
- âœ… Detailed feedback
- âœ… If wrong: Misconception detected
- âœ… Remediation strategy
- âœ… Time estimate to fix

**Quick Test Buttons:**
- Use "Sample Questions" buttons to test system
- Try before pilot to familiarize yourself

---

### Step 5: Review Results with Teacher (10 minutes)

**Key Questions:**
1. Does AI score match your judgment?
2. Is feedback helpful and appropriate?
3. Are misconceptions correctly identified?
4. Would you use this to save grading time?

**Document:**
- Accuracy: AI correct ___/10 evaluations
- Time saved: ___ minutes
- Teacher satisfaction: ___/10
- Would use again: Yes/No

---

### Step 6: (Optional) Generate Pathway

**For 1-2 struggling learners:**

1. Go to: http://localhost:3001/pathways
2. Enter:
   - Learner ID
   - Current skills (e.g., "counting, basic addition")
   - Target skills (e.g., "fractions, fraction operations")
   - Grade level
   - Timeframe (4-8 weeks)
3. Click "Generate Learning Pathway"
4. Wait 20-30 seconds
5. Review AI-generated weekly plan

**Check:**
- Are activities age-appropriate?
- Does progression make sense?
- Would you assign this to the learner?

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Successful Pilot

### Before Pilot:
1. âœ… Test with 2-3 sample questions yourself
2. âœ… Check both backends are running
3. âœ… Prepare questions in advance
4. âœ… Have scoring rubric ready for comparison
5. âœ… Brief teacher on what to expect

### During Pilot:
1. âœ… Start with correct answers to build confidence
2. âœ… Then try wrong answers to see misconception detection
3. âœ… Compare AI feedback to your own feedback
4. âœ… Note any surprising or incorrect evaluations
5. âœ… Track time spent on each step

### After Pilot:
1. âœ… Review data collected
2. âœ… Get teacher impressions
3. âœ… Calculate actual cost
4. âœ… Identify issues/improvements
5. âœ… Decide: expand pilot or adjust?

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Frontend won't load
```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend errors
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Can't connect frontend to backend
- Check `http://localhost:8000/health` returns `{"status":"healthy"}`
- Check CORS is enabled (already configured)
- Check both servers running on correct ports

### API costs too high
- Expected: $0.0001 per evaluation
- If higher: Check token usage in logs
- Solution: Reduce `max_tokens` in backend `.env`

---

## ðŸ’° Cost Expectations for Pilot

**10 learners Ã— 5 questions = 50 evaluations**

| Item | Quantity | Cost Each | Total |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Correct evaluations | 30 | $0.00006 | $0.002 |
| Wrong evaluations | 20 | $0.00010 | $0.002 |
| Misconception detections | 15 | $0.00019 | $0.003 |
| **Total** | | | **$0.007** |

**Your pilot will cost less than 1 cent!**

## ðŸ“ž Support During Pilot

### If something breaks:
1. Check backend logs (Terminal 1)
2. Check frontend logs (Terminal 2)
3. Restart servers if needed
