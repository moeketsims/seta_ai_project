| Answer Evaluation (correct) | $0.000056 | 222 |
| Answer Evaluation (wrong) | $0.000093 | 304 |
| Misconception Detection | $0.000193 | 546 |
| Pathway Generation | $0.000685 | 1,411 |

### Cost Efficiency:
- **Answer Evaluation:** $0.00007 average = **$0.07 per 1,000 evaluations**
- **Misconception Detection:** $0.00019 = **$0.19 per 1,000 detections**
- **Pathway Generation:** $0.00069 = **$0.69 per 1,000 pathways**

- 3,200 answer evaluations: $0.22
- 1,000 misconception detections: $0.19
- 200 pathway generations: $0.14
- **Total:** ~$0.55 USD

**For 500 Learners (Annual):**
- 40,000 evaluations: $2.80

## ⚡ Performance Analysis

### Response Times:
| Operation | Time | Acceptable? |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Status/Features (no AI) | <1s | ✅ Excellent |
| Health Check | 1.78s | ✅ Good |
| Answer Evaluation | 3.2s avg | ✅ Good |
| Misconception Detection | 7.2s | ✅ Acceptable |
| Pathway Generation | 22.7s | ✅ Acceptable* |

*Pathway generation is complex (1,000+ tokens) and run infrequently, so 20-30s is acceptable.

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Caching:** Response caching could reduce costs by 40-60%
2. **Async Processing:** Pathway generation could run in background
3. **Batching:** Multiple evaluations could be batched
4. **Model Tiering:** Use GPT-3.5-turbo for simple MCQ/T-F questions
