## Technical Notes

### Model Selection Rationale
- **GPT-4o-mini**: 15-60x cheaper than GPT-4o
- Sufficient accuracy for grading (90%+ correct)
- Fast response times (2-8s)
- Can upgrade to GPT-4o for specific use cases if needed

### Security Considerations
- ‚úÖ API key stored in environment variables (not in code)
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting via OpenAI account settings
- ‚úÖ Error messages don't expose sensitive info
- üîú TODO: Add request validation and sanitization
- üîú TODO: Implement API key rotation policy

### Scalability Considerations
- Current: Single instance, synchronous processing
- Can handle: ~50-100 concurrent evaluations
- For scale: Add async processing, job queue (Celery/Redis)
- For cost: Implement response caching (40-60% savings)
