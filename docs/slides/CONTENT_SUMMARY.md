## How to Apply the Education 2023 Template

Since PowerPoint templates (.potx files) cannot be programmatically applied while preserving all formatting, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Apply Template in PowerPoint (Recommended)
1. Open `ETDP_SETA_Education_Presentation_2023.pptx` in PowerPoint

### Option 2: Manual Design Updates
If the template doesn't apply cleanly, you can manually update:
- Font styles (use Education 2023 theme fonts)
- Color scheme (apply Education 2023 color palette)
- Slide backgrounds and layouts
- Header/footer styles
