# How to Add Education 2023 Template Footer

## üéØ Quick Method: Copy Footer from Template

### Step 1: Open Both Files
1. **Education template** should already be open (the blank one)
2. **Your presentation**: `ETDP_SETA_Final_Education_2023.pptx` (already open)

### Step 2: Check Template Footer
In the Education template window:
1. Look at the bottom of any slide
2. Note what appears in the footer (logo, text, page numbers, etc.)

### Step 3: Apply Footer to Your Presentation

#### Method A: Header & Footer Dialog (Easiest)
1. In your presentation (`ETDP_SETA_Final_Education_2023.pptx`)
2. Go to menu: **Insert ‚Üí Header & Footer**
3. You'll see options for:
   - ‚òê Date and time
   - ‚òê Slide number
   - ‚òê Footer (text box)
   - ‚òê Don't show on title slide
4. Check the boxes you want and enter footer text
5. Click **"Apply to All"**

#### Method B: Copy Slide Master (Most Accurate)
1. In the **Education template** window:
   - Go to **View ‚Üí Master ‚Üí Slide Master**
   - You'll see the master slides with footer layout
   
2. Select the main master slide (usually the first/largest one)

3. Look for footer elements:
   - Text boxes at the bottom
   - Logos or graphics
   - Slide numbers
   - Date fields

4. **Copy the master**:

## üîß Method C: Use Copy-Paste with Theme

This is actually why the **copy-paste method** I mentioned earlier is best:

1. **Open**: `Education PowerPoint 2023.potx` (creates blank presentation with theme)
2. **Copy all slides** from `ETDP_SETA_Final_Education_2023.pptx` (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)
3. **Paste** into the Education template window (Cmd+V)
4. **Choose**: "Use destination theme" when prompted
5. **Result**: All slides get Education theme INCLUDING footer automatically! üéâ

This is the most reliable way because PowerPoint handles all formatting including footers.

## üì∏ What to Look For

**In the Education template, check the bottom of slides for:**
- Company/Organization name
- Date or date field
- Slide numbers (#)
- Logo or branding
- Custom text or tagline

**Common Footer Layouts:**
```
[Logo]                     [Footer Text]                    [Page #]
```
or
```
              [Organization Name] | [Date] | [Slide Number]
```
