# üéì AI Mathematics Teacher Assistant - Frontend Mock Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to build a **fully functional front-end mock** of an AI-powered Mathematics Teacher Assistant platform for South African schools (Grades R-12, CAPS curriculum). The platform demonstrates evidence-based pedagogy addressing common mathematics learning errors in South Africa.

## üéØ Core Objectives

1. **Enterprise-Level Design**: Professional, scalable, accessible UI/UX
2. **Evidence-Based Pedagogy**: Address SA-specific mathematics misconceptions
3. **Comprehensive Mock**: Fully functional frontend with realistic mock data
4. **Educational Value**: Demonstrate teaching & learning effectiveness

## üìö Research Insights: SA Mathematics Learning Errors

### Common Misconceptions (Grades 4-9)
1. **Numbers & Operations**
   - "Multiplication always makes numbers bigger"
   - "Division always makes numbers smaller"
   - "You can't subtract a larger number from a smaller one"
   
2. **Fractions & Decimals**
   - "0.5 > 0.23 because 5 > 23"
   - "Fractions can't be greater than 1"
   - "Numerator must always be smaller than denominator"

3. **Algebra**
   - "The equals sign means 'the answer is'"
   - "Letters always represent single-digit numbers"
   - "2x + 3x = 5x¬≤ (concatenation error)"

4. **Geometry**
   - "Perimeter and area are the same thing"
   - "All rectangles are squares"
   - "Angles in triangles don't always sum to 180¬∞"

5. **Data & Probability**
   - "Probability can be > 1"
   - "50/50 means anything is equally likely"
