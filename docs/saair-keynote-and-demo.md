# SAAIR 2025 Keynote + Demo Playbook (Analytics‑Only)

Audience: Institutional Research, Planning, Quality, Teaching & Learning, and Funding leaders at the Southern African Association for Institutional Research (SAAIR).

Theme anchor: “Towards Excellence: Enhancing Funding Pathways and Student Outcomes through Human‑Centric AI, Impactful Research, and Operational Intelligence.” Use the DISCO pillars: Data, Impact, Strategy, Capacity, Optimisation.

Objective: Deliver a non‑technical keynote and demo focused on educational value and the use of data. No architecture, frameworks, or UI design discussion.

---

## 1) Positioning (30–45 seconds)
- Crisis → capability: move from lagging indicators to leading signals that trigger timely action.
- Promise to the room: earlier support, better funding decisions, auditable improvements within one term.
- Ground rules: privacy‑respecting, human‑centric, equity‑aware, and measurable.

## 2) Three Analytics Stories (the live demo)
Use clearly labelled synthetic data. Keep vocabulary non‑technical.

- Early Warning & Intervention Latency
  - Show: weekly risk trajectory by cohort; “time‑to‑intervention” distribution; % at‑risk students supported within 7 days.
  - Why it matters: converts end‑of‑term stats into mid‑term actions.
  - Target: ≤7‑day median latency; +10pp on‑track share for target cohort.

- Misconception Clusters → Teaching Time Saved
  - Show: top misconception clusters; mastery lift after targeted sessions; teacher minutes saved per week.
  - Why it matters: directs instruction to highest return areas.
  - Target: −20% repeat errors on targeted skills; ≥15 minutes/week saved per class.

- Funding Pathways ROI
  - Show: micro‑bursary/tutoring triggers tied to risk and momentum; retention delta; cost‑per‑graduate trend.
  - Why it matters: aligns scarce funds with moments of maximum impact.
  - Target: +5pp term‑to‑term retention for supported group; directional cost improvement.

## 3) DISCO Mapping (one‑liners on a slide)
- Data: Weekly leading indicators with clear lineage and audit notes.
- Impact: Latency↓, mastery↑, retention↑, equity‑gap↓.
- Strategy: Fits existing reporting cadences; informs senate/council decisions.
- Capacity: Simple advisor/lecturer workflows; IR evaluation kit.
- Optimisation: Detect → route → act → learn loop.

## 4) Metric Definitions (plain language)
- At‑risk share: portion predicted to under‑perform without support.
- Intervention latency: days from risk flag to first support action.
- Mastery lift: percentage‑point increase on targeted skills within two weeks.
- Retention: re‑enrolment next term/year; show cohort and sub‑groups.
- Equity gap: outcome differences by background (e.g., quintile‑school, first‑gen).
- Cost‑per‑graduate: finance metric; display as a directional signal.

## 5) Governance & Ethics (one slide)
- Privacy and duty of care: data minimisation, role‑based access, audit trails.
- Human‑centric principles: agency, inclusion, transparency, human‑in‑the‑loop.
- Evaluation: pre‑declared metrics, disaggregated results, independent IR sign‑off.

## 6) 90‑Day Pilot Blueprint
- Weeks 1–2: Baseline — freeze metrics, IR validation, equity baselines.
- Weeks 3–8: Run the loop — weekly review; mid‑term readout.
- Weeks 9–12: Summative evaluation; decision memo on scaling.

## 7) Run‑of‑Show (35–40 minutes)
- 00:00–03:00 Opening narrative and theme link.
- 03:00–18:00 Live analytics demo (3 stories).
- 18:00–24:00 Evaluation & governance.
- 24:00–30:00 Pilot plan & partnership ask.
- 30:00–40:00 Q&A.

## 8) Slide Titles (≤15)

15. Call to Action: One Cohort, One Pathway, Now

## 9) Demo Data Pack (synthetic)
- Cohort: First‑year STEM, 1,200 students, 6 classes, 12 weeks.
- Baseline: 32% at‑risk; median intervention latency 14 days; retention 72%.
- Targets: 22% at‑risk; latency 7 days; retention 78–80%; equity gap −3pp.
- Label every screen: “Demo data (synthetic)”.

## 10) Words to Avoid (stay non‑technical)
- Avoid: model, AUC, micro‑service, schema, embeddings, React, FastAPI.
- Prefer: early signals, weekly patterns, risk and response, time saved, outcomes.

## 11) Closing Script (60 seconds)
“Human‑centric AI is not code. It’s capacity. When we surface early signals, route support fast, and learn what works, funding follows evidence and students feel it in time. Let’s pick one cohort, one risk, and one pathway — and measure the difference this term.”

Notes for speakers only (not on slides):
- Tie examples to South African HE context (reporting cadence, IR functions, funding constraints).
- Keep every chart actionable: what action does this insight trigger this week?
- If asked about tech, pivot: “Happy to chat offline; today is about outcomes and evidence.”
