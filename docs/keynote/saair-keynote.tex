\title{From Crisis to Capability: Building AI that Works Where It Matters Most for Learning\\\large Towards Excellence in South African Mathematics Education through Human-Centric Analytics}
\author{Prepared for SAAIR}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This keynote articulates an educationally grounded, analytics-led approach to improving mathematics outcomes in South Africa. It focuses on how timely diagnostics, misconception analysis, and personalized learning pathways can be translated into institutional practice through human-centric analytics and operational intelligence. Rather than describing technical implementations, it centers on instructional value, equity, and evidence-based decision-making. The system described here---a mathematics teacher assistant and analytics environment---demonstrates how weekly diagnostic signals, error analyses, and classroom-facing visual representations (including virtual manipulatives and multiple representations) are converted into earlier support, improved mastery, and more effective allocation of scarce resources. The narrative is organized to resonate with Institutional Research (IR), Teaching and Learning, Quality Assurance, and Funding stakeholders, aligning with the SAAIR theme and the South African context.
